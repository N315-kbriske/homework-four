      The Game is a mind game in which the objective is to avoid thinking about
      The Game itself. Thinking about The Game constitutes a loss, which must be
      announced each time it occurs. Tactics have been developed to increase the
      number of people who are aware of The Game, and thereby increase the
      number of losses.
